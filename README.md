# Wildlife-Classifier

## Overview
This project is a **Wildlife Classifier** built using **Python** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model classifies images of various wildlife species using deep learning techniques.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-based classification** using CNN
- **Pre-trained model support** (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch)
- **Custom dataset training** support
- **Real-time image classification**
- **User-friendly interface** (CLI or GUI if implemented)

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of images of different wildlife species.
- It can be sourced from public datasets like **Kaggle**, **ImageNet**, or custom datasets.
- Data preprocessing includes **image resizing, normalization, and augmentation**.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abhia2531/Wildlife-Classifier.git
   cd wildlife-classifier
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download or prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training
1. Run the training script:
   ```sh
   python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```
2. The model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

## Testing & Inference
1. To classify an image:
   ```sh
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```
2. The output will display the predicted class with confidence score.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a **web-based interface** using Flask or Streamlit.
- Add **real-time classification** using webcam input.
- Train on a **larger dataset** for improved accuracy.
